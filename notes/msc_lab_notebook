--- WEEK 1---
Mo, 17.03.25:
- first day
- set up workspace, Pc, environment, and harddrive
- got overview over project from patrick (whats the overall expectation, possibilities, milestones)
- mirrored eel data from berlin onto new harddrive
- looked at hardware, talked about what there is todo for berlin
- started collecting and reading papers

Di, 18.03.25:
- reading papers
- reading through patricks labstarter
- initializing structures according to labstarter
- set up git repo
- set up headphones via bluetooth to listen to wav files

Mi, 19.03.25:
- reading papers
- looked at eel data w audian
- started working on syncing audio and video data from eels

Do, 20.03.25:
- booked trains for berlin
- worked on sync code (implemented changes so it runs for berlin eellogger files instead of gopro, made interactive plot to define small window for LED trigger and return roi coordinates)


---WEEK 2---
Mo, 24.03.25:
- meeting w jan and patrick about what we will do in berlin
- connected 2 grids for berlin
- built new case for second amplifier
- sautered fake fish for calibrating grids

Di, 25.03.25:
- worked on sync script (made function that calculates relative roi coordinates from the absolute coordinates that the interactive plot returns. adjusted color space for green and checked if mask picks LED signal from video up. implemented that when time_frame is shorter than 5 min, length of video is being taken.)
    -> all of this works now
- hardware w patrick: test grid functionality, prepare stuff for berlin

Mi, 26.03.25:
- read a paper (Social predation in electric eels, bastos 2020)
- started making example dataset for berlin with wav files
- resautered amplifiers with patrick

Do, 27.03.25:
- (worked on clark gp submission upsi)
- finished sautering and preparing hardware for berlin
- finished making example dataset for eel peakfinder script (data from day 20.03.25, ca 14-19:30)


---WEEK 3---
Mo, 31.03.25:
- train to berlin
- looked at eels
- made plans how and when to record eel data

Di, 01.04.25:
- started eel rec at app. 4 pm
- talked to stefan mucha about plans for pulse detection

Mi, 02.04.25:
- patrick talk in lab meeting of mucha group
- specified plans for pulse detection project
- ende of eel rec app. 2 pm
- talked to marisa tietge bc of patricks involvement in her bat data analysis
- jan grewe and alex arrived in berlin
- dinner with lindner group

Do, 03.04.25:
- train back to tÃ¼bingen at 9:20 with patrick
- first look at eel data
- read a paper


---WEEK 4---
Mo, 07.04.25:
- calibrated grid w patrick (3 attempts, once sine generator turned off, once files were not written correctly (no idea why, 0 bytes), third time it worked)
- found out that top platine of logger no. 1 has 473 instead of 472 resistors (47 Ohm instead of 4,7; both had gain of 1x)
    - mittelwert problem (antiphasic 'signal' on other electrodes than the one taking the signal) was worse for 4,7 than 47 ohm resistors
    - use 47 resistors in future
    - problem: data we recorded in berlin with these loggers is now not accurate
- got new screen

Di, 08.04.25:
- spent whole day trying to get .avi files to work

Mi, 09.04.25:
- again whole day to get avi files to work
    - they play on windows vlc with settings demuxer > h264
    - don't work on anything else (linux, other media players, vlc command line)
    - reason: h264 codec in avi container without any metadata (timestamps for frames, framerate, channels, ..)
    - batch convert avi to mp4 works; only in windows vlc gui (possibly demuxer setting has to be reverted to standard for conversion)
    - plan: batch convert all avi files on windows laptop from lab

Do, 10.04.25:
- did water exchange for fish
- started working on plotting course of day of eel data
- struggled with debugging, ruff, cells in vscode
- stopped where I have to determine which spikes were made in which minute in order to make histogram over time

---WEEK 5---
Mo, 14.04.25
- educated myself on how to make ruff work, debugging and cells in vscode
- read paper

---WEEK 6---
Fr, 25.04.25:
eel analysis code
# add spike counts to correct bin for each file
# rewrote code to load npz files one by one, instead of creating data_list
# rewrote code to correctly assign peaks to bins (not just stack more bins at the end)
# discard peaks at start and end of rec where not whole length of bin is covered by data
# code works for single file
# code works for sup folder
# make wav file importing work for sup folders
# make extraction of rec length and sample rate work for several files

---WEEK 7---
Mi, 30.04.25:
# function geschrieben die checkt ob recordings subsequent sind und paths in recording sessions speichert

Fr, 02.05.25:
# made it work that start and end bin are percentually calculated and not disregarded
# fixed mistakes
# started implementing session function in peaks over time

---WEEK 8---
Mo, 05.05.25:
# implemented session function in peaks over time, iterating over sessions instead of all paths now
# new implementations works for sup folders
# skip files if filename doesnt start with eellogger
# initiated offset and start idx variables to count up peak idx and assign correctly to subsequent bins (within and across recordings)

Di, 06.05.25:
# finished function that checks for faulty files
# implemented faulty_files functionj in check_sessions function
# wrote function to trim nans if they are at edges of list
# make it work for no file (check with wav files if there should be a file)/empty npz file

Mi, 07.05.25:
# implement faulty files in peaks_per_bin
# soft coded start and end bin
# initiated global variables
# changed logic for files that are present but no peaks detected (not treated as faulty files anymore)
# peaks_per_bin checks now if there are any valid peaks in the file
# check current code version
# try on big dataset

Do, 08.05.25:
# wav files have to match naming pattern to be included in wav path list
# files that dont start with eellogger (also eelgrid) are not in wav file list
# fixed check_sessions function to work for multiple subsequent None values
# killed remove nans at edges function bc its redundant with new check sessions logic
# empty wav files are now not included in wav file list
# if peak idx reaches maximum bin it is reset to continute in bin idx 0
# synchronized berlin videos (buggy, audio track too short, some variables unnessecary/wrong)
# --> code works for big dataset, ran code through big dataset for first time & got first figure/histogram!!

Fr, 09.05.25
# arbeit bei ari

---WEEK 9---
Mo, 12.05.25
# video sync code
# found what mistakes could be
# duration and offset variables are defined several times, video start time extracted from metadata not relevant variable but wrong

Di, 13.05.25
# fixed video sync bug (logic in create_new_audio_track didnt work if only one wav file for whole video)
# jan said he thinks syncing is correct now, based on correlations with eel behavior

Mi, 14.05.25
# make seperate script for preprocessing
# save session paths dict as json
# load json file in analysis script
# make errorbar in preprocessing script
# add main functions in both scripts
# run preprocessnig script to create json file
# lena back from vacation (talked whole morning hehe)
