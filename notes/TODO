Today TODO:
- paper lesen
- grid kalibrieren
- Look at Berlin eel data (extract as much info from that before berlin as possible > answer open questions below)
- patrick git video sync klÃ¤ren
- readme pushen
- avi file pushen

General TODO:
  - read papers & summarize info from papers in .txt
  - solve watching .avi files
  - adjust shortcuts in vs code!!
  - open thunderfish and thunderlab
  - get headphones to work with audian
  - look through word logging files
  - record gnathostoma data

Open questions Eel:
  - which animal spikes with higher frequency
  - does one animal have bigger amplitude even when normalized
  - how long do they sleep
  - how does spike pattern change during day
  - what type of spiking activity/spike shape do they display
  - does spiking activity correlate to external factors
  - do they react to each other
  - is positive pole of electric field really at head of animal
  - try to watch underwater camera files from eels on pc

Overview Project:
  - Software:
	detect peaks
	flip signal
	normalize signal
	UMAP
	HDBScan
	>> cluster spikes, get ID for each fish
	use ID for tracking fish w patricks algorithm
  - Hardware:
	build more small, rigid grids
	build second tetraeder w cables inside
