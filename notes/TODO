Today TODO:

General TODO:
  - read papers & summarize info from papers in .txt
  - adjust shortcuts in vs code!!
  - get headphones to work with audian
  - set up windows laptop to change video format
  - look at more data

Hardware TODO:
  - kalibrieren mit verstärker der an netz hängt (ground)
  - check and fix amplifiers (pin lötstellen)
  - make 250 electrodes
  - make kabelbäume

Video Sync TODO:
  - sync script clean up and implement filter and improve plotting
  - check if new audio fits synced audio

Eel Analysis TODO:
  - look through word logging files and more data, make csv for metadata from word files
  - do activity curve per electrodes,
  - progress analysis script for other timescales & do correlations
  - switch sem to std
  - try 95 percentile
  - plot median/mean statt counts
  - check double pulse occurance in whole dataset w find peaks function

  --------------------
Open questions Eel:
  - which animal spikes with higher frequency
  - does one animal have bigger amplitude?
  [x] how long do they sleep
  [x] how does spike pattern change during day
  [x] what type of spiking activity/spike shape do they display
  - does spiking activity correlate to external factors
  - do they react to each other
  - is positive pole of electric field really at head of animal

Overview Project:
  - Software:
	detect peaks
	flip signal
	normalize signal
	UMAP
	HDBScan
	>> cluster spikes, get ID for each fish
	use ID for tracking fish w patricks algorithm
  - Hardware:
	build more small, rigid grids
	build second tetraeder w cables inside
