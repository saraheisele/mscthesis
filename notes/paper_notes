The Astonishing behavior of electric eels - Catania 2019 (read on 19.03.2025)

- 2 EODs:
    high voltage - volleys for hunting, doubles for localization of prey
    low voltage for radar
- high voltage and low voltage EODs don't interfere (eel can use low voltage EOD for radar while high V burst)

Hunting:
- high V bursts contract preys muscles and stun it so eel can catch it
- high V doubles used to localize hiding prey, makes prey twitch involuntarily, followed by burst high V attack
- eel can localize any conductor solely relying on EODs (experiment where eel strikes on graphite rod instead of plastic rods that it cant see)
- dipole attack: to deliver stronger shock to prey, eel curls up to increase strength of electric field between head and tail (double voltage that prey feels)

Self defense:
- high voltage
- leaping attack: eel jumps out of water to touch smt with head (lower jaw)
- voltage shock is way higher bc higher R in air; current travels through eels body and into attackers body
- most effective when attacker is also in water
- V = R*I (when R increased, V increased)
- measured peak current of leaping attack in small eel of 43 mA (measured on himself)
- eel size scales with current strength

Social predation in electric eels - Bastos 2020 (read on 26.03.25)
- elecrophorus voltai
- high/low voltage output systems
- eels work together to hunt (video !!)
- prevailing understanding: hunt alone using high voltage charges in shallow waters
- social hunting behavior observed in amazon river, shallow area i which they hunt
- first time seen 2012, observed this behavior 5 times during 72h in 2015
- deeper area in which eels rest
- acidic, low conductivity, low oxygen, warm water

- four main states eels go through in 24 h period:
    resting, interacting, migrating, hunting
- predation in dusk and dawn
- males and females
- interaction period, commotion on water surface, app. 20 min long
- then eels swim together to hunting grounds, up to over 100 animals
- herd fish into prey ball in very shallow water
- 2-10 animals launch synchronized high v strike (sinusoidal motion of eels bodies, observable visually)
- this stunnes fish, eels go in an feed
- some eels maintain prey ball, some strike
- 5-7 prey ball events during one hunting event (app. 2 hours)

- why not just hunt alone if capable to do so?
- school of fish are overwhelming for single predators
- maximizing income of hunt by working together
- same eel groups use same hunting grounds for years (do they share knowledge of good hunting grounds, other social benefits?)
- surprisingly low aggression levels within these groups
- evolutionary driven by availability of prey and self organizing social mechanics
    if hunting with other individual is succesful eels go back to hunting with those same individuals

- Social predation framework:
    sociality: given in these scenarios
    communication: highly suggested by observed behaviors
    dependence: eels seem to be dependent on this group foraging
    resource sharing: no hierarchy, fair sharing of prey
    specialization: no role specific for individuals, roles are fluent

- No info about genetics and EODs during social hunting behavior

Reproductive effort and terminal investment in a multispecies assemblage of Amazon electric fish - Waddell 2021 (read on 03.04.25)

- brachyhypopomus
- upper amazon (terra firme stream)
- looked at 5 species
- metrics of reproductive effort (gonad and EOD condition) increased towards end of final breeding season
- somatic condition decreased towards end of final breeding season
- found in males and females
- liver condition increased in females (necessary for producing eggs), but decreased in males
- carcass condition decreased in both males and females
- 4 species only have one breeding season, 1 species has 2 breeding seasons (B. beebei)
     - in B. beebei these correlations were only found in the final season, not in the first alone

Electric Eel foraging optimization based control design of islanded microgrid - Ebrahim 2025 (read on 14.04.25)

- micro grids that operate independent from the main electrical/energy grid
- microgrid: local energy distribution system (source: mostly renewable), can be connected or disconnected to large grid
- usages: community, industrial complex
- rely on power converters (converts raw energy to AC)
- grid feeding converters: push power into existing electrical grid, need grid forming unit
- grid forming converters: maintain stable voltage and frequency, set electrical rhythm
--> not really relevant, electric eels are proposed for model for microgrids, basically applied paper from social predation in eels paper (bastos)

Electric Eels Concentrate Their Electric Field to Induce Involuntary Fatigue in Struggling Prey - Catania 2015 (read on 14.04.25)

- eels amplify electrical power to exhaust prey
- when hunting: initial burst of high voltage pulses to stun prey
- enough to stun small fish long enough for eel to catch and eat it
- for more tricky prey (crayfish, bigger fish): eel curls its body, brings its head to its tail
- this intensifies the electric field around prey so even stronger fish are stunned and can get captured
- dipole attack: curling at least doubles around prey
- pulses correspond to behavior
- setup: eels attack pithed fish (brain, nervous system and muscles still intact but gutted)
- the closer head to tail the higher measured voltage
- voltage measured in pithed fish
- motorneurons of prey involuntarily contract from high frequency stimulation
- muscle fatigue less pronounced when voltage was cut in half (dipole attack is effective bc it increases amplitude)
- burst frequency also critical for fatigue
- initial shock leads to few sec of immobility, eel uses that to capture it, fatigue makes prey easy to swallow without fight and without getting hurt by prey resistance
- initial shock doesnt work on all prey, e.g. crayfish
- biological amplifier/self amplifier
- very strategic hunting

Electric eels use high-voltage to track fast-moving prey - Catania 2015 (read on 15.04.25)

- 4 eels, electrophorus electricus

- high voltage discharge is not just used to hunt but also sensory system
- high voltage pulses used to track prey and hunt it
- when weakly electric fish use EOD (low voltage) for sensory stuff, its possibly the same for eels
- but not just low voltage pulse of eels but also high voltage organ important

1. Experiment
- pithed, anesthetized fish seals in insulated plastic bag, covered by agar barrier
- fish twitches but eel cant sense fish with chemical or tactile cues, only electrical (control for vision in experiment 3)
- twitch induced by current stimulator
- when eel sensed twitch it swims toward pitched fish and makes high voltage volley
- BUT no full feeding response (suction strike)

1.2 Experiment
- added rods near fish, under agar
- 6 plastic, one carbon rod, look same
- in this setup, eel responded same first (immediate response to twitch, turn to fish, high voltage strike)
- with carbon rod: eel also tries to feed at carbon rod (suction strike) --> 6/6 times
- eel ignored plastic rods

- twitch: sensory input, information about possible prey
- eel makes high voltage volley to confirm that preyis present (?)
- if no electrical feedback, no feeding strike
- feeding response only when  electrical feedback (carbon rod) to their own voltage strike!!
- sensory conflict: eel starts moving towards twitch, but abruptly changes course to carbon rod

2. Control experiment
- same setup with fish and agar but only plastic rods, no carbon rods
- same response as in 1.: eel shoots high voltage volley in response to fish, no attempted suction feeding

3. spinning disk experiment
- to check tracking abilities of eel and how it uses high voltage output for that
- fast spinning disk (to mimick fast moving prey)
- disk is under agar barrier (no tactile and chemical cues)
- but there is one whole in agar barrier
- conducting and non conducting elements on disk (3 plastic disks, 1 graphite)
- no vision, done in darkness, racked w infrared light which eels cant see
- infrared diods that indicate low and high voltage strikes

- eels ignore plastic rods, but follows and strikes at carbon rods
- strikes only happened at high voltage discharge, not low voltage
- low voltage likely for searching/radar
- eel makes suction strike exactly when carbon rod is under whole in barrier

3.2 to check for precsion of electrical sensing
- 15 plastic disks, 1 carbon
- rotating at 45 s/m -> way faster than prev recorded for active electrolocation in weakly electric fish
- high voltage system probably much faster feedback
- full illumination (to check if vision helps)
- no agar
- eel can still track graphite plate well and shows suction strike, using high voltage organ

- graphite is inert, so no passive electrical sensing of faint signals
- agar would block low voltage, only let through high voltage
- low voltage system used for passive sensing, radar - high voltage system used for precise and fast electrolocation, to track prey
- dual purpose of high voltage system
- eel needs high resolution feedback to high V strike to guide following strikes correctly on preys location

- mechanical things other than fish movement, like water splash alert eel as well

Electrochemical Capacitors with High Output Voltages that Mimic Electric Eels -  Sun 2016 (read on 23.04.25)

- tries to solve problem of how to make energy efficient technology
- especially for portables or wearables (flexible)
- electrochemical capacitors
- voltage problem: store max amount of voltage in small, flexible device, optimally waterproof
- more batteries = bulky/heavy

Eel approach:
- thousands of electrocytes (small & flexible)
- each electrocyte produces around 1.5V
- electrocytes are arranged in series
- all electrocytes add up to up to 600V

Umsetzung:
- fine, flexible fibre (500µm diameter)
- wrapped fibre with multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) in 60° degree angle
- in regelmäßigen abständen 0.2 cm gap, hier kein MWCNT sheet
- coating gel electrolyte (conductive) everywhere but middle segment of MWCNT sheets
- non coated MWCNT sheet acts as common electrode
- gel coating creates electrodes (?) that are connected through non coated MWCNT -> linked in series
- embedding PANI into MWCNT increased its specific capacitancen (70 wt% PANI)
- PANI improved charge discharge stability and reduced series resistance -> app. 20x more energy storage
- (the more units the more resistance)

Results:
- single unit capacitors pretty well controllable
- discharge time increases linerarly with segment length i.e. unit number
- good electrochemical stability at different bending and stretch and at higher voltages up to 10 V (?)
- stretching improved capacitance
- connecting multiple units for high voltage worked (5 units = 5 V)
- 83% capacitance after 100.000 charge discharge cycles
- 12m long fibre was able to store 1000V

Application:
- wove capacitor fibres into textiles (t shirt, wristwatch band)
- weavable power source/storage/capacitor -> many applications
- higher capacitance, stretchability, flexibility compared to other systems
- doesn't rely on external power source
- combined fibre with solar cell -> energy conversion rate of 6.2% (pretty decent for this tech)
- 10V from 16 solar cells connected to same fibre
- solar harvesting integrated into capacitor section -> shared MWCNT
- fibre can now convert solar energy to electricity and store that electricity at high Voltage
- one flexible, self-powered capacitor

The shocking predatory strike of the electric eel - Catania 2014 (read on 29.04.25)

- E. electricus
- up to 600 V
- 3 ms after high V volley prey fish is paralyzed

mechanism of prey immobilisation:
- pithed fish, so only peripheral nerve and muscle reaction can be measured
- eel hunts worms
- pithed fish seperated from eel with agar plate (seperated mechanically but not electrically)
- 3-4 ms after first high V pulse fish contracted
- fish contraction is equally strong to maximum twitch that could be elicited on purpose
- electrically induced tetanus

muscle or nerve immobilisation:
- 2 fish next to each other behind agar barrier
- one fish treated with curare, other got saline
- fish w curare almost no muscle tension, other fish same amount as in prev experiments
- eels shock acts on nervous system of prey, specifically motor neurons
- high frequency and amplitude discharge very effective to immobilize

- fish in plastic bag and behind agar (isolated from eel in all senses but mechanically)
- if researcher makes fish twitch after doublet of eel; attack
- same response if fish twitched without probing doublet
- no attack if fish doesn't twitch after doublet


################ SUMMARY CATANIA PAPERS ################
- NEXT JOURNAL CLUB
usual hunting strategy of eel:
- probing environment with small V pulses
- then high V doublet, to force prey to twitch (mechanosensory detection)
- attack in direction of prey with high V volley
- prey immobilized after 3 ms
- if too big/tricky, eel concentrates electric field around it to put more force into paralyzing prey
- high V volley also used to very precisely sense prey location and confirm that is prey (electrosensory feedback necessary for feeding attempt)

Reproductive biology of the neotropical armoured catfish Hoplosternum littorale (Siluriformes - Callichthyidae): a synthesis stressing the role of the floating bubble nest - Gérard Hostache, Jan H. Mol (read on 30.01.26)

- bubble nest crucial for reproductive behavior (synchronization signal) and for konkurrenz um females (almost half of the nests didnt have eggs in them)
- males make bubble nest, 30 cm diameter, 6 cm high, topped with vegetation
- triggers for nest building: beginn der regenzeit, anstieg wasserpegel um 30 cm ist notwendiger Reiz, reduktion der Leitfähigkeit kann nestbau induzieren
- konstruktion passiert nachts und wird innerhalb einer nacht abgeschlossen
- männchen baut nest in mitte von revier das er verteidigt, bleibt bei nest für 3 Tage bis larven schlüpfen und danach nochmal ca 3 Tage
- wäjrend dieser zeit produziert männchen regelmäßig neuen schuam um nest instandzuhalten
- unklar ob schaum aus mund, kiemen oder anus erfolgt
- schaum hat amylase aktivität (wichtig?)
- männchen macht erst nest, dann legt er pflanzen shit drauf
- nester oft an grasbüscheln befestigt
- pro nest ca 20.000 eier im schnitt, von 2-4 weibchen

MEMBRANE POTENTIALS IN THE ELECTROPLATES OF THE ELECTRIC EEL - KEYNES 1952 (read on 06.02.26)

- propose that mechanism behind high voltagte shocks are similar to impulse propagation in nerve and muscle
- EOD consists of multiple layers of electroplates
- electroplates consist of nervous and non--nervous face, nervous face points towards eels tail
- non nervous face has extremely low resistance (0.23 Ohmcm**2) - this is important so pulse can flow thourhg those cells without too much resistance
- electroplates are probably specialized muscle tissue
- potentials during pulse are additive across all electroplates
- used 2 microelectrodes and determined potential diff between them
- using direct coupled differential amplifier
- electrodes placed in small portion of electric tissue (~3 electroplates thick)
- E. electricus, 11 animals
- resting potential: -84 mV, same on both faces of electroplates (this verifies bernsteins hypothesis from 1912)
- shock: action potential of 150 mV on nervous face of each electroplate (potential reversal/overshoot)
- non-nervous face stays inactive
- 1.7 m/s propagation
- all or none response, i.e. spike only if enough potential there, otherwise no spike, threshhold potential at almost 12 mV
- spike shapes depend on temp, longer spikes on cooling
- avg. spike duration 2.4 ms at half peak amplitude
- peaks that are drawn in this paper have a small peak before the main peak
- small peak infront of big peak happens at the same time over the whole surface but the main pulse travels (fig. 15)
- at peak of spike the potential between the two faces of the electroplate switches due to the massive depolarization and all potentials are in series (and thus added up)
- head of eel becomes positive, tail negative, during discharge
- sachs and main organ are physiologically very different, suggesting that sachs has a specialized function other than increasing main organs output
- ALREADY showed that e. electricus can sense conductors in water & that search pulses originated from posterior end of el. organ (sachs organ?)

- Synchronität: whole surface of electroplate activated at virtually same time in a spike
- no meaningful propagation of the spike, therefore conceptually more similar to squid axon in voltage/space clamp than normal axon
- eel electroplate reflects membrane dynamics, not cable propagation
- upstream control of synchronization: Spinal electromotor neurons with very large, fast, myelinated axons, firing in highly synchronized bursts
- electroplates activated by this synced firing
- High density of voltage-gated Na⁺ channels on the innervated face, low excitability on the opposite face, prevents circular or traveling excitation
- single, uniform dipole per plate, no internal waves running around the membrane

Ontogeny of the Electric Organs in the Electric Eel, Electrophorus electricus : Physiological, Histological, and Fine Structural Investigations - Horst O. Schwassmann 2014 (read on 10.02.26)

- talk about how electric organs develop from embrionic to juveline states
- e. electricus
- main finding: electrocytes are not modified muscle cells but originate directly from electromatrix i.e. germinative region
- first main organ develops, then sachs organ (at 12 cm length)
- EOD onset at 7 days old larvae
- adult EOD pattern at 45 mm length
- electroplates are sperated by electrosepta (bindegewebe)
- longitudinal electrosepta seperate columns of electrocytes
- median septum seperates both halves of later main organ
- electrosepta are necessary for correct innervation and electric activity
- structural analysis also verifies that electrocytes are distinct from and dont originiate from muscle cells
- actin like filaments in electrocytes (propably important to make them flat)
- behavior changes drastically relating to ontogenesis of electric organs
- swimming: oriented swwimming in larvae from 6-10 days, before that larvae sinnk to ground if they fall out of nest
- first swimming like snake, from length 30-40mm on, they use anal fin and sideways movement of tail for swimming
- high V burtsts from length of 35 mm
- reaction to mechanical or electrical stimuli from 22-30 mm
- high volume hum in nests (eachb larvae pulses normal but loud bc of group)
- clear differentiation into low and high V pulses from 45 mm length (important point in development)

Unexpected species diversity in electric eels with a description of the strongest living bioelectricity generator - David de Santana (read on 11.02.26)

- first paper that shows that there are 3 instead of 1 electrophorus species
- based on genetic, morphological and ecological distribution
- morphological: skull shape and depth, pectoral fin rays, cleithrum position
- ecological: conductivity, oxygen level, rapids vs floodplains
- e. voltai and varii described as new species in this paper
- electricus:
    - guiana shield
    - u shaped head
    - 88-101 lateral line pores
    - 480 V discharge
    - 2,03 bis 2,19 ms sachs organ waveform
- varii:
    - lowland flood plains , intercratonic basin
    - low cond. blackwaters and high cond whitewaters, normoxic streams and hypoxic floodplains, slow flowing, no rocky substrate
    - 572 V discharge
    - 124-186 lateral line pores
    - deepened skull
    -  1,24 bis 1,78 ms sachs organ waveform
    - breeds in dry period so offspring is independent in wet season
- voltai:
    - brazilian shield
    - normal oxygen level, low conductivity, rocky ground/rapids/waterfalls
    - egg shaped head
    - 860 V discharge (strongest recorded)
    - 1,72 ms sachs organ waveform (assumed)
- voltai and varii cooccur in some streams in guiana shield
- voltai and varii may have diverged due to adjustment to these different habitats (reflected by head morphology, different for difference in water speed)
- there are differences in waveform but they dont correlate with phylogeny
- langth of sachs organ pulse is different for each species, esp. for voltai and varii
- reason for different length of EOD in varii and voltai might be their sympatric occurance (reproductive character displacement)
