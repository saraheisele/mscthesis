The Astonishing behavior of electric eels - Catania 2019 (read on 19.03.2025)
# maybe for journal club?

- 2 EODs:
    high voltage - volleys for hunting, doubles for localization of prey
    low voltage for radar
- high voltage and low voltage EODs don't interfere (eel can use low voltage EOD for radar while high V burst)

Hunting:
- high V bursts contract preys muscles and stun it so eel can catch it
- high V doubles used to localize hiding prey, makes prey twitch involuntarily, folllowed by burst high V attack
- eel can localize any conductor solely relying on EODs (experiment where eel strikes on graphite rod instead of plastic rods that it cant see)
- dipole attack: to deliver stronger shock to prey, eel curls up to increase strength of electric field between head and tail (double voltage that prey feels)

Self defense:
- high voltage
- leaping attack: eel jumps out of water to touch smt with head (lower jaw)
- voltage shock is way higher bc higher R in air; current travels through eels body and into attackers body
- most effective when attacker is also in water
- V = R*I (when R increased, V increased)
- measured peak current of leaping attack in small eel of 43 mA (measured on himself)
- eel size scales with current strength

Social predation in electric eels - Bastos 2020 (read on 26.03.25)
- elecrophoris voltai
- high/low voltage output systems
- eels work together to hunt (video !!)
- prevailing understanding: hunt alone using high voltage charges in shallow waters
- social hunting behavior observed in amazon river, shallow area i which they hunt
- first time seen 2012, observed this behavior 5 times during 72h in 2015
- deeper area in which eels rest
- acidic, low conductivity, low oxygen, warm water

- four main states eels go through in 24 h period:
    resting, interacting, migrating, hunting
- predation in dusk and dawn
- males and females
- interaction period, commotion on water surface, app. 20 min long
- then eels swim together to hunting grounds, up to over 100 animals
- herd fish into prey ball in very shallow water
- 2-10 animals launch synchronized high v strike (sinusoidal motion of eels bodies, observable visually)
- this stunnes fish, eels go in an feed
- some eels maintain prey ball, some strike
- 5-7 prey ball events during one hunting event (app. 2 hours)

- why not just hunt alone if capable to do so?
- school of fish are overwhelming for single predators
- maximizing income of hunt by working together
- same eel groups use same hunting grounds for years (do they share knowledge of good hunting grounds, other social benefits?)
- surprisingly low aggression levels within these groups
- evolutionary driven by availability of prey and self organizing social mechanics
    if hunting with other individual is succesful eels go back to hunting with those same individuals

- Social predation framework:
    sociality: given in these scenarios
    communication: highly suggested by observed behaviors
    dependence: eels seem to be dependent on this group foraging
    resource sharing: no hierarchy, fair sharing of prey
    specialization: no role specific for individuals, roles are fluent

- No info about genetics and EODs during social hunting behavior

Reproductive effort and terminal investment in a multispecies assemblage of Amazon electric fish - Waddell 2021 (read on 03.04.25)

- brachyhypopomus
- upper amazon (terra firme stream)
- looked at 5 species
- metrics of reproductive effort (gonad and EOD condition) increased towards end of final breeding season
- somatic condition decreased towards end of final breeding season
- found in males and females
- liver condition increased in females (necessary for producing eggs), but decreased in males
- carcass condition decreased in both males and females
- 4 species only have one breeding season, 1 species has 2 breeding seasons (B. beebei)
     - in B. beebei these correlations were only found in the final season, not in the first alone

Electric Eel foraging optimization based control design of islanded microgrid - Ebrahim 2025 (read on 14.04.25)

- micro grids that operate independent from the main electrical/energy grid
- microgrid: local energy distribution system (source: mostly renewable), can be connected or disconnected to large grid
- usages: community, industrial complex
- rely on power converters (converts raw energy to AC)
- grid feeding converters: push power into existing electrical grid, need grid forming unit
- grid forming converters: maintain stable voltage and frequency, set electrical rhythm
--> not really relevant, electric eels are proposed for model for microgrids, basically applied paper from social predation in eels paper (bastos)

Electric Eels Concentrate Their Electric Field to Induce Involuntary Fatigue in Struggling Prey - Catania 2015 (read on 14.04.25)

- eels amplify electrical power to exhaust prey
- when hunting: initial burst of high voltage pulses to stun prey
- enough to stun small fish long enough for eel to catch and eat it
- for more tricky prey (crayfish, bigger fish): eel curls its body, brings its head to its tail
- this intensifies the electric field around prey so even stronger fish are stunned and can get captured
- dipole attack: curling at least doubles around prey
- pulses correspond to behavior
- setup: eels attack pithed fish (brain, nervous system and muscles still intact but gutted)
- the closer head to tail the higher measured voltage
- voltage measured in pithed fish
- motorneurons of prey involuntarily contract from high frequency stimulation
- muscle fatigue less pronounced when voltage was cut in half (dipole attack is effective bc it increases amplitude)
- burst frequency also critical for fatigue
- initial shock leads to few sec of immobility, eel uses that to capture it, fatigue makes prey easy to swallow without fight and without getting hurt by prey resistance
- initial shock doesnt work on all prey, e.g. crayfish
- biological amplifier/self amplifier
- very strategic hunting

Electric eels use high-voltage to track fast-moving prey - Catania 2015 (read on 15.04.25)

- high voltage discharge is not just used to hunt but also sensory system
- high voltage pulses used to track prey and hunt it
- when weakly electric fish use EOD (low voltage) for sensory stuff, its possibly the same for eels
- but not just low voltage pulse of eels but also high voltage organ important

1. Experiment
- pithed, anesthetized fish seals in insulated plastic bag, covered by agar barrier
- fish twitches but eel cant sense fish with chemical or tactile cues, only electrical (control for vision in experiment 3)
- twitch induced by current stimulator
- when eel sensed twitch it swims toward pitched fish and makes high voltage volley
- BUT no full feeding response (suction strike)

1.2 Experiment
- added rods near fish, under agar
- 6 plastic, one carbon rod, look same
- in this setup, eel responded same first (immediate response to twitch, turn to fish, high voltage strike)
- with carbon rod: eel also tries to feed at carbon rod (suction strike) --> 6/6 times
- eel ignored plastic rods

- twitch: sensory input, information about possible prey
- eel makes high voltage volley to confirm that preyis present (?)
- if no electrical feedback, no feeding strike
- feeding response only when  electrical feedback (carbon rod) to their own voltage strike!!
- sensory conflict: eel starts moving towards twitch, but abruptly changes course to carbon rod

2. Control experiment
- same setup with fish and agar but only plastic rods, no carbon rods
- same response as in 1.: eel shoots high voltage volley in response to fish, no attempted suction feeding

3. spinning disk experiment
- to check tracking abilities of eel and how it uses high voltage output for that
- fast spinning disk (to mimick fast moving prey)
- disk is under agar barrier (no tactile and chemical cues)
- but there is one whole in agar barrier
- conducting and non conducting elements on disk (3 plastic disks, 1 graphite)
- no vision, done in darkness, racked w infrared light which eels cant see
- infrared diods that indicate low and high voltage strikes

- eels ignore plastic rods, but follows and strikes at carbon rods
- strikes only happened at high voltage discharge, not low voltage
- low voltage likely for searching/radar
- eel makes suction strike exactly when carbon rod is under whole in barrier

3.2 to check for precsion of electrical sensing
- 15 plastic disks, 1 carbon
- rotating at 45 s/m -> way faster than prev recorded for active electrolocation in weakly electric fish
- high voltage system probably much faster feedback
- full illumination (to check if vision helps)
- no agar
- eel can still track graphite plate well and shows suction strike, using high voltage organ

- graphite is inert, so no passive electrical sensing of faint signals
- agar would block low voltage, only let through high voltage
- low voltage system used for passive sensing, radar - high voltage system used for precise and fast electrolocation, to track prey
- dual purpose of high voltage system
- eel needs high resolution feedback to high V strike to guide following strikes correctly on preys location

- mechanical things other than fish movement, like water splash alert eel as well

Electrochemical Capacitors with High Output Voltages that Mimic Electric Eels -  Sun 2016 (read on 23.04.25)

- tries to solve problem of how to make energy efficient technology
- especially for portables or wearables (flexible)
- electrochemical capacitors
- voltage problem: store max amount of voltage in small, flexible device, optimally waterproof
- more batteries = bulky/heavy

Eel approach:
- thousands of electrocytes (small & flexible)
- each electrocyte produces around 1.5V
- electrocytes are arranged in series
- all electrocytes add up to up to 600V

Umsetzung:
- fine, flexible fibre (500µm diameter)
- wrapped fibre with multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) in 60° degree angle
- in regelmäßigen abständen 0.2 cm gap, hier kein MWCNT sheet
- coating gel electrolyte (conductive) everywhere but middle segment of MWCNT sheets
- non coated MWCNT sheet acts as common electrode
- gel coating creates electrodes (?) that are connected through non coated MWCNT -> linked in series
- embedding PANI into MWCNT increased its specific capacitancen (70 wt% PANI)
- PANI improved charge discharge stability and reduced series resistance -> app. 20x more energy storage
- (the more units the more resistance)

Results:
- single unit capacitors pretty well controllable
- discharge time increases linerarly with segment length i.e. unit number
- good electrochemical stability at different bending and stretch and at higher voltages up to 10 V (?)
- stretching improved capacitance
- connecting multiple units for high voltage worked (5 units = 5 V)
- 83% capacitance after 100.000 charge discharge cycles
- 12m long fibre was able to store 1000V

Application:
- wove capacitor fibres into textiles (t shirt, wristwatch band)
- weavable power source/storage/capacitor -> many applications
- higher capacitance, stretchability, flexibility compared to other systems
- doesn't rely on external power source
- combined fibre with solar cell -> energy conversion rate of 6.2% (pretty decent for this tech)
- 10V from 16 solar cells connected to same fibre
- solar harvesting integrated into capacitor section -> shared MWCNT
- fibre can now convert solar energy to electricity and store that electricity at high Voltage
- one flexible, self-powered capacitor
