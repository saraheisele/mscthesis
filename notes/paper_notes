The Astonishing behavior of electric eels - Catania 2019 (read on 19.03.2025)
# maybe for journal club?

- 2 EODs:
    high voltage - volleys for hunting, doubles for localization of prey
    low voltage for radar
- high voltage and low voltage EODs don't interfere (eel can use low voltage EOD for radar while high V burst)

Hunting:
- high V bursts contract preys muscles and stun it so eel can catch it
- high V doubles used to localize hiding prey, makes prey twitch involuntarily, folllowed by burst high V attack
- eel can localize any conductor solely relying on EODs (experiment where eel strikes on graphite rod instead of plastic rods that it cant see)
- dipole attack: to deliver stronger shock to prey, eel curls up to increase strength of electric field between head and tail (double voltage that prey feels)

Self defense:
- high voltage
- leaping attack: eel jumps out of water to touch smt with head (lower jaw)
- voltage shock is way higher bc higher R in air; current travels through eels body and into attackers body
- most effective when attacker is also in water
- V = R*I (when R increased, V increased)
- measured peak current of leaping attack in small eel of 43 mA (measured on himself)
- eel size scales with current strength

Social predation in electric eels - Bastos 2020 (read on 26.03.25)
- elecrophoris voltai
- high/low voltage output systems
- eels work together to hunt (video !!)
- prevailing understanding: hunt alone using high voltage charges in shallow waters
- social hunting behavior observed in amazon river, shallow area i which they hunt
- first time seen 2012, observed this behavior 5 times during 72h in 2015
- deeper area in which eels rest
- acidic, low conductivity, low oxygen, warm water

- four main states eels go through in 24 h period:
    resting, interacting, migrating, hunting
- predation in dusk and dawn
- males and females
- interaction period, commotion on water surface, app. 20 min long
- then eels swim together to hunting grounds, up to over 100 animals
- herd fish into prey ball in very shallow water
- 2-10 animals launch synchronized high v strike (sinusoidal motion of eels bodies, observable visually)
- this stunnes fish, eels go in an feed
- some eels maintain prey ball, some strike
- 5-7 prey ball events during one hunting event (app. 2 hours)

- why not just hunt alone if capable to do so?
- school of fish are overwhelming for single predators
- maximizing income of hunt by working together
- same eel groups use same hunting grounds for years (do they share knowledge of good hunting grounds, other social benefits?)
- surprisingly low aggression levels within these groups
- evolutionary driven by availability of prey and self organizing social mechanics
    if hunting with other individual is succesful eels go back to hunting with those same individuals

- Social predation framework:
    sociality: given in these scenarios
    communication: highly suggested by observed behaviors
    dependence: eels seem to be dependent on this group foraging
    resource sharing: no hierarchy, fair sharing of prey
    specialization: no role specific for individuals, roles are fluent

- No info about genetics and EODs during social hunting behavior

Reproductive effort and terminal investment in a multispecies assemblage of Amazon electric fish - Waddell 2021 (read on 03.04.25)

- brachyhypopomus
- upper amazon (terra firme stream)
- looked at 5 species
- metrics of reproductive effort (gonad and EOD condition) increased towards end of final breeding season
- somatic condition decreased towards end of final breeding season
- found in males and females
- liver condition increased in females (necessary for producing eggs), but decreased in males
- carcass condition decreased in both males and females
- 4 species only have one breeding season, 1 species has 2 breeding seasons (B. beebei)
     - in B. beebei these correlations were only found in the final season, not in the first alone
